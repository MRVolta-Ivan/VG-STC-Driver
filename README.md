# VG-STC-Driver
This repo is to house the source vode for a custom Windows Universal User Mode Driver to support the Samsung VG-STC5000 camera on Windows OS.

## The Need
The VG-STC5000 video camera is a high quality device design for use with a Smart TV, but it is no longer supported. I felt the need to write my own driver so I could use such a great camera on Windows devices and not simply be constrained to using the Smart TV.
